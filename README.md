# Faced with the challenge imposed, they choose to use vue js in the construction of the application as it is a little 
more didactic in some aspects. So I built the screens being a home with the tabs to change between form and graph all the 
information entered in the form will be automatically added to the graph. 
# In the graph we have an option of which timeline you want to see and the option to clear the entire graph to implement the chart I used the chart vue itself to create less packages to be installed generating a smaller weight for the project. 
# To start after downloading the project pass the YARN command to install the dependencies after this step the yarn dev command can be given to start the project.
